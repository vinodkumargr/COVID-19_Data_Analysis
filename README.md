# COVID-19_Data_Analysis

Dear Student,
The objective of the final project is to put into practice one (or more) of the tools that
you have seen in this course. You can use Excel, Power Query, Power BI, SQL,
Python, Machine Learning or any other visualisation tool, method or software that
can help you to implement the final project.
IMPORTANT: The focus of the project is on Visualisation! That means that the grading
will be mainly based on how you visualised and represented the data (e.g. answers to
your research questions).
You can take a scenario where an executive from the company X for which you work
will receive the final presentation and will have to take a decision based on the insights
he/she saw in the PPT/PDF or else the presentation that you sent to him/her (this is just
an illustrative example).
COVID-19 Project: The aim of the Final project is to make some basic data
manipulations and visualisation of the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases
worldwide.
Research questions:
1. Do the curves of cases and deaths have an upward trend globally?
2. Does any continent have a distinct ascending curve of cases?
3. What date was noted with the highest daily number of new cases? In
which country?
4. Does the epidemiological situation in France differ in comparison to
Cuba?
Overall, you should aim at applying some of the techniques that include, but are not
limited to, data cleaning, data verification, data exploration, aggregation, visualisation,
etc.
Dataset can be downloaded from HERE.
Possible manipulations:
● Clean the data
● Validate data
● Use slicers by continent/month
● Use the geographical map to represent the top 10 countries by deaths
● Use a pivot table (of cases and deaths by months (globally)
● Answer research questions.
Delivery & Submission
The outcome of the project should be a PowerPoint presentation where you will
explain:
● Executive Summary
● The background of the project
● The research questions
● Steps taken to clean the data/verify/automate/explore/etc (these are just
examples)
● The approach/method/tool used
● Results (visualisation)
IMPORTANT NOTE: You should position the deliverable (the result) as if you were to
send it for a high-level overview to a CEO/Director of the company who has to take an
important strategic decision based on the data analysis/insights that you have
prepared.
